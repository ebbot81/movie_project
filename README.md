# movie_project

This is my very own dataset containing my own movies, I used Pandas and TKinter to complete the project.

Instead of going through my entire movie list one by one to find what I want to see, I can now easily by the help of radiobuttons narrow it down by choosing Year, Genre, Duration and IMDB rating after my own choosing.
